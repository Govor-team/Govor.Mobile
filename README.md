# School Messenger – .NET MAUI Client

Cross-platform client for my school messenger project (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS).  
Backend is in a separate repository: ASP.NET Core Web API + SignalR (add the link here when you create it).

**Project under active development** — I work on it in the evenings and on weekends, so updates come frequently, sometimes with fresh bugs :)

## Current Features
- Connection to the server (WebSocket + SignalR)
- Login and registration
- Chat list and real-time private conversations
- Sending/receiving text messages and images
- Notifications (local for now, Firebase push notifications coming soon)
- User profile with avatar upload/change
- Light/dark theme + system theme support

## Design
I'm using **glassmorphism (liquid glass)** style with subtle animations and blur effects.  
It looks modern and really tasty, especially in dark mode.  
Screenshots will be added below as soon as the UI reaches a presentable state.

## Upcoming Features (ever-growing to-do list)
- Group chats
- Voice messages + playback
- Video calls (WebRTC)
- Stickers and message reactions
- End-to-end encryption (maybe)
- Full push notifications via Firebase
- Message and user search
- Settings page (notifications, privacy, etc.)
-: Lots and lots of UI/UX polishing
